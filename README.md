# Bifrost Starting Page

Welcome to Bifrost, a tailor-made starting page built for my personal needs.

## Features

- **ToDo-list:** A very simple list to remember some important stuff to handle.
- **Links:** A list of links, used as a Bookmark collection.
- **Search:** The ability to doa web search.

### Links
To utilise links you need to add a folder and a json-file, data/links.json. The content should look like this example:

```json
[
  {"name": "Name of link", "url": "https://www.example.com"},
  {"name": "Name of link_2", "url": "https://www.example.com"}
]
```
